## Payment service playground

This is part of a "playground" project to test PayPal APIs.

Simple page, with a product to checkout. Insert your buyer info (or use the info pre-filled), click "go to payment" and click PayPal Button to pay.

You can use this two accounts to test the flow:

- Login: pauladiaz@gmail.com

       ||

- Login: testusaccount@paypal.com
- Password: test123123


Let me know if there is some question or if you find any bug.
